# SpotiFrog
A frog-themed music-sharing platform

Welcome to "Spotifrog," where every hop is a musical leap!

This isn't just another tadpole in the pond of music streaming sites; it's a fully-grown, ribbet-rocking platform.

Imagine a world where bullfrogs belt out the blues, and tree frogs trill the top charts.

Our users don't just play music; they leap onto a lily pad of lyrical landscapes.

Uploading songs is as easy as a frog catching flies ‚Äì simply hop onto the platform, croak out your tunes, and watch as your music ripples across the pond.

With Spotifrog, every artist can have their moment in the swamp-light, whether they're a croaking classicist or a poison dart performer.

So, tune in, turn up the volume, and let the amphibious anthems amphibi-rock your world! üê∏

## Installation Instructions

### Back-end

* Decide on database / ORM; we used SQLAlchemy/Sqlite-developemtn/PostGreSQL-production/AWS-large files (media/pictures/art)...for these instructions we'll assume you follow in our footsteps!
* Install packages needed, and dependencies on any other packages
* create a .env file with appropriate environment variable settings (see .env.example for values)
* if you use PostGreSQL, you will need to set a SCHEMA= variable to a snake_cased name
* set up seed values in
